                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p class="text-justify">Black tea is one of the most widely consumed teas. This tea is prepared from the leaves of the shrub Camellia sinensis and is more oxidized than oolong, green and white teas. Thus, it generally has a stronger flavour than the other varieties of tea.</p>
                
                <p class="text-justify">The method of black tea production makes it different from the other varieties of tea. After being plucked, the tea leaves are withered in order to release the moisture from them. When they lose the maximum amount of moisture, the leaves are rolled, either manually or with the help of machines, through exposure to high temperature. Once the leaves are oxidized fully, they are sorted according to their size.</p>
                
                <h4>Oral Health</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">Studies funded by the Tea Trade Health Research Association suggests that black tea reduces plaque formation as well as restricts bacteria growth that promotes the formation of cavities and tooth decays. Polyphenols found in black tea kill and surpass cavity-causing bacteria as well as hinder the growth of bacterial enzymes that form the sticky-like material that binds plaque to our teeth.</p>

                <h4>Healthy Bones And Connective Tissue</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">The powerful phytochemicals in black tea help in strengthening the bones and connective tissue. In fact, research has proved that black tea drinkers have comparatively healthier bones.</p>

                <h4>More Energy</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">Due to caffeine, black tea is considered an energizing drink that increases the efficiency. Caffeine, when taken in moderation, acts as a stimulant by increasing the brain function and alertness. In fact, the stimulating effect of caffeine in black tea is more than that of coffee and cola. Black tea has another compound called ‘theophylline’ that stimulates the respiratory system, heart and kidneys. Thus, these compounds help in maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system.</p>

                <h4>Cancer Prevention</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">Though a lot more research is required to confidently suggest cancer prevention techniques, some research over the years suggests that antioxidants like polyphenol and catechins in tea may help prevent some types of cancer. It has been suggested that women who drink black tea regularly have a lower chance of ovarian cancer than their counterparts.</p>

                <h4>Hair care</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">Using black tea rinses as part of your hair care regimen adds shine, luster and natural darkness to your hair because of its dark hue. For this purpose, add 3 bags of tea to 6 cups of boiling water. After keeping this mix for an hour at room temperature, pour it on your head and wrap your hair in a towel. Wash your hair normally after an hour or two.</p>

                <h4>Better Immune System</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">Black tea contains alkylamine antigens that help boost our immune response. In addition it also contains tannins that have the ability to fight viruses and hence keep us protected from influenza, stomach flu and other such commonly found viruses in our everyday lives.</p>

                <h4>Skin Benefits Of Black Tea</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">In addition to its various health benefits, black tea is also considered good for your skin. Black tea is rich in vitamins B2, C and E, minerals such as magnesium, potassium and zinc, and some essential polyphenols and tannin. Thus, its nutritional value makes it beneficial for the skin in many ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Due to its high caffeine content, drinking black tea can kill oral viruses and thus, help in preventing skin infections and keeping your skin blemish-free.</li>
                        
                        <li>Placing moist tea bags under your eyes helps in reducing puffiness.</li>
                        
                        <li>Black tea also helps in reducing mimic wrinkles, and preventing pre-mature ageing and pimples. Thus, those suffering from these skin problems can try having one or two cups of black tea daily for beneficial results.</li>

                        <li>The antioxidants present in black tea provide protection against skin cancer.</li>

                        <li>The extract of black tea acts as a sun blocking agent when applied on the skin.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
