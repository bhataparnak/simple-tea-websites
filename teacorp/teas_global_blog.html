                <h3>White Tea</h3>
                <div class="col-md-3 text-center"><img src="images/image2.jpeg" style="max-width:100%;"></div>
                <div class="col-md-9 text-justify"><p>White tea is the least processed of all teas. They comprise of tea buds that are harvested by hand. A tea bud is the infant stage of a tea leaf and harvested before it grows into a leaf and the production of Chlorophyll. Therefore tea buds are white with minute down like hairs visible to the naked eye. Once harvested, they are spread out to dry. The drying period can vary depending on the dryness of the air, which is dependent on the weather conditions. Dry natural air produces the best quality and flavor in the tea. Processing is basically the removal of moisture from the buds. No handling, rolling or bruising of any kind is acceptable and when dried to the required time the dried buds are collected and packed, ready for sale.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Health benefits of white tea include reduced risk of cancer, cardiovascular disorder and improvement in oral health. It has antioxidant and anti-aging properties which help in maintaining good health and healthy skin. It protects skin from the harmful effects of UV light. With its antibacterial properties white tea protects the body from various infection causing bacteria.White tea provides relief to diabetic people from symptoms such as decrease plasma glucose levels, increase insulin secretion and excessive thirst (polydipsia).  Intake of white tea also helps in losing weight.</p></div>

                <h3>Matcha Tea</h3>
                <div class="col-md-3 text-center"><img src="images/image1.jpeg" style="max-width:100%;"></div>
                <div class="col-md-9 text-justify"><p>Matcha is finely ground powder of specially grown and processed green tea. It is special in two aspects of farming and processing: The green tea plants for matcha are shade-grown for about three weeks before harvest, and the stems and veins are removed in processing.This results in the slowing down of growth, making the leaves darker green and also causes the production of Amino acids. Only the finest tea buds are hand picked. After harvesting, if the leaves are rolled out before drying as usual, the result will be Gyokuro (jade dew) tea. If the leaves are laid out flat to dry, they will crumble and become known as tencha. Tencha can then be de-veined, de-stemmed, and stone ground to the fine, bright green, powder known as Matcha. The highest grade of Matcha is used in the Japanese Tea ceremony.</p></div>
                <p class="lead">What are the Health Benefits of Matcha Tea?</p>
                <p>One serving of matcha tea is the nutritional equivalent of 10 cups of regularly brewed green tea</p>
                <p><ul>
                <li>When you drink matcha you ingest the entire leaf and receive 100% of the nutrients of the leaf.</li>
                <li>Matcha powdered green tea has 137 times more antioxidants than regularly brewed green tea.</li>
                <li>One cup of matcha = 10 cups of regularly brewed green tea in terms of nutritional content.</li>	
                </ul></p>
               
                <h3>Oolong Tea</h3>
                <div class="col-md-3 text-center"><img src="images/image3.jpg" style="max-width:100%;"></div>
                <div class="col-md-9 text-justify"><p>The name Oolong tea came into the English language from the Chinese name meaning "black dragon tea". Oolong tea is produced from cultivars of Camellia Sinensis through a process including withering and oxidation before rolling in muslin bags to bring about curling and twisting of the leaves. Most Oolong teas, especially those of fine quality, are produced from unique tea plant cultivars that are exclusively used for particular varieties. The degree of oxidation can range from 10% to 80% depending on the variety and production style. The lower oxidized Oolong teas are commonly referred to as green Oolongs because their appearance is somewhat greenish (example Ti Kwan Yin Oolong) and the more oxidized ones are called dark Oolongs because their appearance is dark, and close to black teas (example Wu Yi Oolong).</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Health benefits of oolong tea include the reduction of chronic health conditions such as heart disease, inflammatory disorders, and high cholesterol levels, while providing vital antioxidants, promoting superior bone structure, robust skin and good dental health. Oolong tea is fragrant with a fruity flavor and a pleasant aroma.</p>
                </div>
               
                <h3>China Black</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">China black teas are commonly referred to as Congou and also referred to by the Chinese as Hongcha or Red tea. Black tea is produced in all the tea growing provinces in China, but the most famous black teas are Keemun (first introduced in the Qimen county in Anhui province) and Yunnan from the Yunnan province which is, geographically somewhat close to Assam region of India. This region is said to be where tea was first discovered. Keemun teas are considered one of the top black teas from China and only a certain varietal is used for its manufacture.</p>

                <h3>Puerh Tea</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Puerh is a variety of post-fermented tea produced in Yunnan province, China. Post-fermentation is a tea production style in which the tea leaves undergo a microbial fermentation process after they are dried and rolled. This is a Chinese specialty and is sometimes referred to as dark, or black tea (this type of tea is completely different from what in West is known as "black tea", which in China is called "red tea"). There are a few different provinces, each with a few regions, producing dark teas of different varieties. Those produced in Yunnan are generally named Puerh, referring to the name of Puerh county which used to be a trading post for dark tea during imperial China.</p>

                <h3>Green Tea</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Green tea is made from un-oxidized leaves and is one of the less processed types of tea (with white tea the least) and therefore contains one of the most antioxidants.</p>

                <h3>Indian Black</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">India is the world’s largest producer and consumer of tea, 95% of which is black tea. There are three tea growing regions are they are ; Darjeeling, Nilgiri and Assam.The method of black tea production makes it different from the other varieties of tea. After being plucked, the tea leaves are withered in order to release the moisture from them. When they lose the maximum amount of moisture, the leaves are rolled, either manually or with the help of machines, through exposure to high temperature. Once the leaves are oxidized fully, they are sorted according to their size.</p>
