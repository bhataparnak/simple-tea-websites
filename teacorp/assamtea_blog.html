                <p class="text-justify">Commercial production of tea in India began after the conquest of large areas by the British East India Company, at which point large tracts of land were converted for mass tea production.The widespread popularity of tea as a recreational drink began in earnest in the 1920s, after a successful advertising campaign by the Tea Board and several mass promotion drives by the Government, using railway stations as a base.</p>
                
                <p class="text-justify">Today, India is one of the largest tea producers in the world, although over 70 percent of its tea is consumed within India itself. In this, India is also among the top 5 per-capita tea consumers. A number of renowned teas, such as Assam and Darjeeling, also grow exclusively in India.</p>

                <h3>History of Assam Tea</h3>
               
                <p class="text-justify">Tea drinking first originated in China. The credit of discovery of Assam tea plant goes to Robert Bruce, who noticed the plant growing wild in the hills near Rangpur in 1823 during his trading mission. The leaves of these plants were sent to the botanical gardens, which were later on classified as to be of the same species as the china tea plant. It was in 1839, when the first company for growing and making tea was set up in India, Assam tea was set up.</p>
                
                <p class="text-justify">The cultivation and production of Assam tea in the first two decades (1840–1860) were monopolised by the Assam Company, which operated in districts of Upper Assam and through the labour of the local Kachari community. In the 1862, Assam Tea industry comprised of 160 gardens, which were owned by the five public companies and 57 private companies. Later on the government appointed the special commission to enquire about all the aspects of the company. From than the company start growing and now it one of the major company's generating huge amount of revenue.</p>
                
                <p class="text-justify">Assam tea is a black tea named after the region of its production, Assam, in India. Assam tea is manufactured specifically from the plant Camellia sinensis var.assamica . This tea, most of which is grown at or near sea level, is known for its body, briskness, malty flavour, and strong, bright colour. Assam teas, or blends containing Assam teas, are often sold as "breakfast" teas. For instance, Irish breakfast tea, a maltier and stronger breakfast tea, consists of small-sized Assam tea leaves.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">The state of Assam is the world's largest tea-growing region, lying on either side of the Brahmaputra River, and bordering Bangladesh and Burma (Myanmar). This part of India experiences high precipitation; during the monsoon period, as much as 10 to 12 inches (250–300 mm) of rain per day. The daytime temperature rises to about 103F (40 °C), creating greenhouse-like conditions of extreme humidity and heat. This tropical climate contributes to Assam's unique malty taste, a feature for which this tea is well known.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Though Assam generally denotes the distinctive black teas from Assam, the region produces smaller quantities of green and white teas as well with their own distinctive characteristics.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Each year, the tea estates of Assam collectively yield approximately 1.5 million pounds (680,400 kg) of tea. Assam tea is generally harvested twice, in a “first flush” and a “second flush.” The first flush is picked during late March. The second flush, harvested later, is the more prized “tippy tea,” named thus for the gold tips that appear on the leaves. This second flush, tippy tea, is sweeter and more full-bodied and is generally considered superior to the first flush tea. The leaves of the Assam tea bush are dark green and glossy and fairly wide compared to those of the Chinese tea plant.</p>
