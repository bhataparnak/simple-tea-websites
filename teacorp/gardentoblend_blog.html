                <p class="text-justify">Today it is estimated that there are 1,500 different varieties of tea - that is an amazing choice of teas grown in some 36 countries! There are six main categories that tea can be divided into to; black green, oolong, white, compressed and flavoured teas.</p>
               
                <p class="text-justify">One of the Camellia Sinensis plant’s(tea plant's) most beautiful features is that the flavour of the plant is easily altered by changes in humidity, altitude, weather, light, and temperature. As you can imagine this may make the plant a little finicky to grow, but because of this fickleness each tea is unique and has its own distinct flavour. First, tea leaves are lovingly and carefully handpicked, then they are harvested with the utmost care and attention to detail to ensure their separate flavours come through. All of this work amounts to the types of tea we have available for our drinking pleasure, and why teas from one region - like Darjeeling, Assam, and Nilgiris, all produced in India.</p>
               
                <p class="text-justify">Plucking in tea refers to harvesting or tender apical shoots growing above the pre-determined plucking table. Besides giving crop, it encourages regeneration of new shoots, checks vertical growth of bushes and keeps them in vegetative phase. Plucking accounts for 70 - 80% of total cost of green leaf production. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.</p>

                <h4>The tea factory and black tea processing</h4>
                
                <p class="text-justify">On arrival at the factory, the plucked leaf is spread on large trays or racks, normally placed at the top of the factory, and are left to wither in air at 25-30 degrees centigrade. The moisture in the leaf evaporates in the warm air leaving the leaves flaccid. This process can take between 10 to 16 hours, depending on the wetness of the leaf. Some factories will gently hasten the process with the aid of warm air fans. The withered leaf is broken by machine so that the natural juices, or enzymes, are released and on contact with the air will oxidise. This breaking is done by two methods "Orthodox" and "Unorthodox" - terms are used to describe the machinery used.</p>
                
                <p class="text-justify">The Orthodox machine rolls the leaf, which produces large leaf particles, known as grades. While the "Unorthodox" term covers teas broken by either a CTC (cut, tear and curl) or Rotovane machine. Both chop the leaf into smaller particles than those which are produced by the Orthodox method. The smaller particles are more suited to modern market demands for a quicker brewing finished product. The broken leaf is laid out either on trays or in troughs in a cool, humid atmosphere for 3-4 hours to ferment, or oxidise, and is gently turned every so often throughout the period until all the leaves turn a golden russet colour and oxidisation is complete.
                </p>

                <p class="text-justify">After oxidisation, the leaf is dried or fired. This is done by passing the broken leaf slowly through hot air chambers where all the moisture is evaporated and the leaf turns a dark brown or black. The black tea is ejected from the hot chamber into chests. Next it is sorted into , or leaf particle sizes, by being passed through a series of wire mesh sifts of varying sizes into containers before being weighed and packed into chests or "tea sacks" for loading onto pallets. After each "make" the tea factory is washed from top to bottom to ensure that the completed make does not contaminate the next make of tea.</p>
